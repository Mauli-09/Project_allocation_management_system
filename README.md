I created a website that based on .Net as backend and HTML,CSS as front end and used microsoft sql server for storing database.
You can just import file name as timesheet from inside zip file in VS code and for sql database upload it on microsoft sql server.
Then run code on VS as sql server check connectivity of server which was connected to laptop that automatically shown on display.
If you have any doubt related to Process of import which are available easily on youtube for better knowledge you can also watch it.
Any issue regrading project DM me on Instagram mauli_.09
